# Revamp of Eventacular Caledar Singapore

### External user's goal
Users come to this website to find out all events and ongoings happening in Singapore, ranging from national holidays, performances at the stadium, expos and various other events happening across the nation. 

### Site owners goal
They want to improve on their organizational layout, and improve on the aesthetics of the website. This is to allow users to navigae the website easliy and have access to a website that is pleasing to the eyes.

## Design Process
- As a user who wants to find events, I want to have a good, organized layout for me to easily find events that i have an interest in.
- As an event organizer, I want people to easily find our event and its details to increase visitors to our event

## Features

### Existing Features
- By having users scroll thorugh the available events listed on the page without organization, users trawl thorugh countless unrelated events to find interesting events that pique their interests.

### Features to Implement
- Have events list event details like venue, category, times etc to allow users to know what type of event this is
- Adds a category page, location search page, and a search bar
- Allows users to search up events using event details to filter out unwanted events


## Testing
On a desktop webpage, contents are aligned in rows and columns when specified.
On a smaller screen like the Samsung S20 FE, most images and layouts are in columns

when clicking on images to see event details, it is supposed to link to each individual event's details and shows specific images and content related to the desired event. however due to time constraint, I have only used IVE concert as a base prototype.

in each individual details page, when the screen shrinks too much, text may clip into the footer bar. this depends on the length of text in the event details.

## Credits
### Content
IVE event details are sourced from ticketmaster
### Media
Images used in this prototype are sourced from ticketmaster @ https://ticketmaster.sg/
### Acknowledements 
I recieved inspiration from TheHoneyCombers as a base idea on revamping an events website to find Singapore events easier.
I then used Ticketmaster as a base reference on the designs and layouts
